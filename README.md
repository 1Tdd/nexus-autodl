> **Note:** This project is a enhanced fork of the original [Nexus AutoDL by parsiad](https://github.com/parsiad/nexus-autodl). A huge thank you to the original creator for laying the foundation for this useful tool.

Nexus AutoDL is an autoclicker designed to automate the process of downloading mods from [Nexus Mods](https://nexusmods.com). When using tools like [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org), modlists can contain hundreds of files, requiring a manual click for each one. This tool automates that tedious process for you.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Windows Users (Recommended)

1.  **Download the `.exe`:** Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/1Tdd/nexus-autodl/releases) and download the `nexus_autodl.exe` file from the latest release.
2.  **Run the App:**
    *   Double-click `nexus_autodl.exe` to start.
    *   Use the **`Create Template`** button to easily capture the download buttons you want to click.
    *   Alternatively, you can manually place screenshot images in a folder and select it with the **`...`** button.
3.  **Start Automating:**
    *   Press **`F3`** to start!

## üéÆ How to Use

1.  **Configure Settings:** Adjust options like `Confidence`, `Sleep` times, or `Always on Top` in the main window if needed.
2.  **Start/Resume:** Press the **`F3`** key. A log console will appear, and the script will begin searching for your template images.
3.  **Pause:** Press the **`F4`** key. The main window will reappear, allowing you to change settings.
4.  **Close the Application:** Simply close the main window or the log console using the "X" button. This will automatically save your settings.

## ‚ö° Maximizing Automation (Optional)

For a truly seamless, zero-wait download experience, you can use this autoclicker in combination with a user script that bypasses the 5-second countdown on Nexus Mods.

*   **Recommended Tool:** [**Nexus No Wait**](https://greasyfork.org/it/scripts/519037-nexus-no-wait) on Greasy Fork.

By using both tools together, Nexus AutoDL will click the download button, and the "Nexus No Wait" script will ensure the download starts instantly, creating a fully automated workflow.
